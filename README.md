## A Note on Passwords

We **never** store passwords in our database. Instead, we use a hashing function to create a password hash or digest. We store the password digest in our database.

## JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication

Here is a flow for using JWT for Authentication

1. The user signs up:

- The client creates a POST request to the `/signup` endpoint on the server with username, email, and password in the request body

2. The server creates a JSON Web Token (JWT) based on a header, payload, and secret
3. The server responds with the JWT
4. The client saves the JWT in localStorage to persist subsequent server requests

Answer the following questions:

1. Why do we need authentication in our Web Apps?

```
Authentication enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users or processes to gain access to their protected resources.
```

2. What is the point of a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction)? Why would we want to use it?

```
JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties because they can be signed, which means you can be sure that the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, the structure of a JWT allows you to verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.
```

3. Why would we hash a user's password when they sign up? What's the point?

```
Password hashing is used to verify the integrity of your password, sent during login, against the stored hash so that your actual password never has to be stored. This is used to prevent anyone with access to the database from stealing the password/tampering with it.
```

4. Go [here](https://jwt.io). Create a JWT with the following as the payload (feel free to change the username/email):

```js
{
  "id": "1",
  "username": "bruno",
  "email": "bruno@ga.co"
}
```

Paste your encoded JWT below:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjEiLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Inl1c29uZyIsImVtYWlsIjoianNoaUBnbWFpbC5jb20ifQ.bsTzl6PfnqQmd8PNoYV4y10MSVPWZBT8HvqdvjI3MMI
