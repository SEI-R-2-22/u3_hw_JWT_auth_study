# Authentication Study

## A Note on Passwords

We **never** store passwords in our database. Instead, we use a hashing function to create a password hash or digest. We store the password digest in our database.

## JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication

Here is a flow for using JWT for Authentication

1. The user signs up:

- The client creates a POST request to the `/signup` endpoint on the server with username, email, and password in the request body

2. The server creates a JSON Web Token (JWT) based on a header, payload, and secret
3. The server responds with the JWT
4. The client saves the JWT in localStorage to persist subsequent server requests

Answer the following questions:

1. Why do we need authentication in our Web Apps?

```

Authentication is needed to securely validate the subject identity and it is a crucial precursor to authorization. Authorization policies start after the authentication process completes. The authorization process determines what data you can access.  
```

2. What is the point of a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction)? Why would we want to use it?

```
The session data is stored on the client side and because of that security vulnerabilities emerge. For example, if the user ID is stored in a cookie, it is easy for that user to modify the cookie and change that ID. This will make it possible to get access to someone elseâ€™s account. To prevent this we can use JWT
```

3. Why would we hash a user's password when they sign up? What's the point?

```
For security  reasons. We hash passwords to prevent an attacker with read-only access from escalating to higher power levels. Hashing passwords provides defense against your passwords being compromised when a database has been compromised. 
```

4. Go [here](https://jwt.io). Create a JWT with the following as the payload (feel free to change the username/email):

```js
{
  "id": "1",
 "username": "MagJoseph",
  "email": "mag@gamail.co"
}
```

Paste your encoded JWT below:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjEiLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Ik1hZ0pvc2VwaCIsImVtYWlsIjoibWFnQGdhbWFpbC5jbyJ9.X7zzt27lPatbhO4Wv_37M0jE3mi9M9I9vq0g4quK79g
